	<h2 align="left"><b> Current Projects: </b></h2>
	<p align="left"> 1. Interpreting Deep Neural Networks: Probing modularity and specialization in Neural Networks. Specialized Neurons emerge in Vision and Large Language Netowrks. Can we modify the current architecture to induce Specialization in an Interpretable way?   </p>

	<p align="left"> 2. Explainable AI: What is common between subsets of data within a clustered region in a t-SNE or UMAP projection of high-dimensional 			data? We're building the Next-gen Visualization tools that Visualization Clusters of Big data and Langauge, and explain what causes 			these clusters to form!</p>

	<p align="left">3.  Data Visualization: Always curious about visualizing interesting datasets! [Pretty Visuals coming soon!] </p>
	<p align="left">4. Check out my previous research on Experimental Physics <a href = "https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=hs94v8AAAAAJ" >here</a>. [TLDR] We use high powered lasers and a vacuum system to cool down atoms and molecules to ultra-low temperatures where we can observe and study Quantum phenomena. This would be usefeul to build the next-gen Quantum Computers that use the complexity of the internal structure of molecules!   </p>
